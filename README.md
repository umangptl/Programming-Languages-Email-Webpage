# Programming-Languages-Email-Webpage
Main Project

Write a Python program that collects, summarizes, and e-mails all the programming assignments for this course.

You should begin by organizing your assignments in a folder structure which will make this easier. I recommend something like:

csc344

a1

a2

a3

a4

a5

Assuming the programs are in subdirectories a1, a2, …, a5 of directory csc344, your program should:

create a summary_ai.html (replacing i with the assignment number) file for each ai, which contains (in reasonably formatted, valid HTML): the name of each source file
(linked to the file itself), along with the number of lines long the file is, and an alphabetized list of all identifiers used in the program (class, function, rule,
variable etc.names), omitting duplicates. You do NOT need to specially filter keywords or builtin functions. Even though something like “for” in C isn’t really 
an identifier, we’ll be OK with including it. We won’t be OK with including punctuation which isn’t part of names, nor will we be ok with commented text.

create a valid HTML web page in the csc344 directory called index.html with links to each of the summary files;

create a tar.gz file containing all assignment sources, but excluding non-sources (executables, .class files, etc). Also included should be the html files

created above. Be sure the links in the webpages work after extraction;

prompt the user for an email address and send the tar.gz file.

You can send mail from the terminal using the mutt command. A little Googling and looking at the man pages should tell you how to use it. The mutt command 
should not prompt the user for any input.
